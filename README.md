# Localwire - Crowdsourcing local events.
The idea of the project is to crowdsource local events and news. People on the ground can contribute, verify and subscribe to that events/news. The service can be made available as a website and app, allowing the public to upload text messages, photos under some predefined sections, like: traffic situation, road, safety, water. Along with the public consuming this news/events, the Govt. authorities can take rectifying actions based on some events.
